Alternatively:
[The code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaitaroH/Import-All-Deepdark/master/ImportDeepDark.css) on github. Simply create a new style with that code and nothing else. userstyles.org doesn't allow code imports, thus I can only host this code here.

### Advantages
> Easily install all my themes.         
> Choose only what themes you want.      
> Have the most up-to-date versions of the themes (I don't upload to userstyles every single release).            
> Allows color changing across all the themes for uniformity and consistency. (If you use @imports)         
> Allows easily color picking using Sylus's UI.
> Changes to the color palettes will not be overwritten by updates.         
> Overwrite the color palettes of the individual themes.         
> It can also work with other themes as long as they have a place to import from such as github. (using the @imports)         

### Disadvantages - IF YOU INSTALL THEM ONE BY ONE USING STYLUS, THEN, THIS DOESN'T APPLY
> You cannot modify or see the code of the themes inside Stylus.         
> Possible lag before the theme is applied on the page.         
> Possible revert to the default color palette in case both the import-all and the original themes are present.         
> It will not work if raw.githubusercontent/rawgit are blocked with extensions such as uMatrix.
