# Import-All-Deepdark
Install my deepdark themes all at once from github. May the dark be kinder on thine eyes.

[The code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaitaroH/Import-All-Deepdark/master/ImportDeepDark.css) on github. Simply create a new style with that code and nothing else.

### Advantages
> Easily install all my themes.         
> Choose only what themes you want by deleting or commenting out the @imports.          
> Have the most up-to-date versions of the themes (I don't upload to userstyles every single release).            
> Allows color changing across all the themes for uniformity and consistency.         
> Changes to the color palettes will not be overwritten by updates.         
> Overwrite the color palettes of the individual themes.         
> It can also work with other themes as long as they have a place to import from such as github.         

### Disadvantages
> You cannot modify or see the code of the themes inside Stylus.         
> Possible lag before the theme is applied on the page.         
> Possible revert to the default color palette in case both the import-all and the original themes are present.         
> It will not work if raw.githubusercontent/rawgit are blocked with extensions such as uMatrix.
