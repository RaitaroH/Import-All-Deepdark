# Import-All-Deepdark
Import all my deepdark themes all at once from github.

[The code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RaitaroH/Import-All-Deepdark/master/ImportDeepDark.css) on github. Simply create a new style with that code and nothing else.

### Advantages
> Easily install all my themes.         
> Choose only what themes you want by deleting or commenting out the @imports.          
> Have the most up-to-date versions of the themes (I don't upload to userstyles every single release).            
> Allows color changing across all the themes for uniformity and consistency.         
> It can also work with other themes as long as they have a place to import from such as github.

### Disadvantages
> You cannot modify or see the code in the themes.
