### Advantages
+ Easily install all my themes.         
+ Choose only what themes you want.      
+ Have the most up-to-date versions of the themes (I don't upload to userstyles every single release).            
+ Allows color changing across all the themes for uniformity and consistency. (If you use the switcher.user.css)                 
+ Allows easily color picking using Sylus's UI.
+ Changes to the color palettes will not be overwritten by updates.         
+ Overwrite the color palettes of the individual themes.         
+ It can also work with other themes as long as they have a place to import from such as github. (using the @imports)         

### Disadvantages - IF YOU INSTALL THEM ONE BY ONE USING STYLUS, THEN, THIS DOESN'T APPLY
+ You cannot modify or see the code of the themes inside Stylus.         
+ Possible lag before the theme is applied on the page.
